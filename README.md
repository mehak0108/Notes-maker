# Notes-maker

## Idea

An android application that aims to create notes of any lecture or some conference or a meeting through the audio lecture delivered. It would also create a short summary of the lecture and audio lecture for the same would also be available. It would also include keyword detection using which the summary will be built and direct link to meanings of specific words would be directed. Sharing of the lecture notes will also be incorporated. The app would also contain three different Modes: Visual, Audio and normal mode which would provide its features to the handicapped and normal people accordingly.

For the Blind:
It is difficult for a blind person to read the books so for that a feature would be added which would scan the book and convert the text to speech.

For the international students:
If a person is speaking french the notes will be written in french which a person living in India will have difficulty to understand so there would be a feature which will convert the text of the notes to any language so that the person could read it easily.

For all the students:
Whenever a professor will announce any date on which he will take a test then automatically a reminder will be added in the app. It is useful for those who donâ€™t listen to the teacher carefully and also forget the date and time of the test. It can be extended in such a case where venue of the test would also be added.
